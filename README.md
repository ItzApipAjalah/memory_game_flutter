# Memory Game

If a player or bot guesses correctly, they continue; otherwise, the turn alternates, and the cards are flipped back. The game also includes scoring to track the performance of the player and bot.

3. **Score**: Earn points for each pair matched correctly.
4. **Bot Play**: The bot will take its turn automatically after the player flips two cards.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when all pairs are matched or no more moves are possible.
